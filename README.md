Fix Macon
=========

With [SeeClickFix](http://seeclickfix.com/macon) now integrated with the
City of Macon's Public Works department, citizens should be able to
report neighborhood issues.  This application aims to help citizens
without internet access report issues through SMS text messages.

The format for sending issues should be an **address** followed by an
**issue**.

These issues will then be added to SeeClickFix through the [Open311
API](http://seeclickfix.com/open311). Text messages will be received
using [SMSified](https://smsified.com).
